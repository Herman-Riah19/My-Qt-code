# My-Qt-code
These projects represent my qualities and opened on the Qt5 framework during my studies at GSI University for 3 years. I discovered the different ways to develop a high quality code project with C / C ++ and the Qt 5.13.1 Framework. I am not a real expert in the development of software packages in C / C ++ infrastructures but still I have already almost 4 years that I have been working on this technology and I still continue to improve myself in order to have more professional qualities. in the field. If you are interested in my projects, you can clone them or share them with your colleagues so that he can improve further and not be anxious to encourage me on your donations in order to improve the quality of my projects.
