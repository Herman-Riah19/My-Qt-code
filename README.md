## 🧩 Overview

**My-Qt-code** is a desktop application developed using C++ and the Qt framework. It serves as a **4G network planning and simulation tool**, designed to help telecom engineers and planners calculate and visualize critical parameters needed for setting up mobile network infrastructure.

Whether you're designing a network for a small city or a rural area, this tool estimates the **number of towers (pylons)**, **cell coverage**, and **required frequencies** based on input parameters like area, environment, and signal reach.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📍 **Coverage Simulation**: Determine how many 4G cells are needed to cover a given geographical zone (urban or rural).
- 📶 **Frequency Calculation**: Automatically estimate frequency allocation and reuse patterns.
- 🗺️ **Tower Count Estimation**: Calculate the number and spacing of network towers (pylons) required.
- 🧠 **Parameter Inputs**: Configure values like radius, area size, terrain type, or population density.
- 💡 **Educational Use**: Useful for engineering students or telecom professionals learning about RF planning.
